# React Suspend Demo - What is it?

**This website renders a GitHub repository's Feature Branches with their state and linking to each deployment.**

<PiGithubLogoDuotone /> Btw. It is also a demo and playground to experiment with React Suspend possibilities:
especially (using RFC 220): latest React and React Server Components and **Next.js** App Router.

### Choose one of these different variants of data loading:

-   [Next based modern](/next)
    **Next.js app router based:**
    Fetching asynchronously, on demand (not fully optimized)
-   [Old way](/restful) **All or nothing:**
    Fetching all data in a top-level `useEffect()` + props-drilling
-   [With One Suspense](/wait-for-all)
    **Global Spinner** Waiting until all data got fetched (modern Promise-based
    way)
-   [Optimised Suspense](/waterfall)
    **Incremental:** Showing results incrementally (waterfall) as soon as they got
    loaded. (modern Promise-based way)
-   [Side-by-Side](/side-by-side)
    **Comparison:** Show incremental loading and wait-for-all
